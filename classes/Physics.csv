2024-05-29,physics is a natural science that studies matter its motion and behaviour through space and time and the related entities of energy and force its sixth understand the fundamental principles of the universe one of the primary fields of physics is classical mechanics which describes the motion of macroscopic objects it is based on Newton's laws of motion the first law also known as the Law of Inertia states that an object at rest stage at rest in an object in motion stage and motion with the same speed in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force the second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object at times its acceleration the third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, Physics is a natural science that studies matter its motion and behaviour through space and time .
